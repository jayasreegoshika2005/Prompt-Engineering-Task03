# Prompt Engineering - Task 03  
This project demonstrates a semi-automated system for transforming user inputs using a structured prompt and a Python script.

## Files Included  
1. *prompt.txt* – The designed prompt used to transform input.  
2. *examples.json* – Three validated input–output example pairs.  
3. *transform.py* – A Python script that accepts user input and returns the transformed JSON output.  
4. *README.md* – Documentation + reflection.
5. ## Reflection  
During this task, I refined the prompt multiple times to make it more consistent and predictable.  
Initially, the output structure varied, so I added strict JSON formatting instructions.  
I also created example input–output pairs to test whether the prompt behaved consistently.  
Finally, I wrote a short Python script to automate the transformation and verify the prompt's reliability.  
This iterative process helped me understand how small prompt changes affect the output quality.
