Task: Prompting for Task Automation

Goal:
- Accept user input as bullets or paragraph.
- Produce JSON with fields:
  - title (string)
  - bullets (array of strings)
  - summary (3–5 sentence string)
  - structured (object with key -> value)

Rules:
1. If input has bullets (lines starting with -, •, *), parse them into "bullets".
2. If input is a paragraph, break into up to 6 short bullets by sentence.
3. Title: use the first short line (<=6 words) or first bullet truncated to 6 words.
4. Summary: 3–5 concise sentences summarizing the main points.
5. structured: extract "Key: Value" or "Key - Value" pairs; otherwise create point_# keys.
6. Output must be valid JSON only — no explanatory text.

Output format example:
{
  "title": "....",
  "bullets": ["..."],
  "summary": "...",
  "structured": {"key":"value"}
}
