Task: Prompting for Task Automation

Goal:
- Accept user input in two forms:
  1) raw notes (free text or bullet points)
  2) short list of facts (bulleted)
- Produce one of:
  A) concise summary (3–5 sentences)
  B) structured JSON extracted from bullets (keys and values)
  C) uniform transformed format: JSON with fields {title, bullets[], summary}

Instructions for model:
1. If input contains bullet markers (“-” or “•”), parse bullets into an array called "bullets".
2. Create a "title":
   - If the first line is short (<=6 words), use it as title.
   - Otherwise use the first bullet (trim to 6 words) as title.
3. Produce a "summary" field: 3–5 complete sentences that capture main points.
4. Produce "structured" field — an object with simple key-value pairs inferred from the bullets.
   - If a bullet contains “X: Y” or “Key - Value”, use that as key/value.
   - Otherwise infer keys like "point1", "point2" with the bullet text as values.
5. Output MUST be valid JSON (top-level object with keys: title, bullets, summary, structured).
6. If the input is plain paragraph (no bullets), extract 4–6 short bullets first, then follow steps 2–5.
7. Keep language concise, avoid adding extra commentary.

Example output format:
{
  "title": "....",
  "bullets": ["bullet1", "bullet2", ...],
  "summary": "3-5 sentence summary here.",
  "structured": {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}
}
